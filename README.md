# My JavaScript Learning Journey 🚀

This repository serves as my personal code journal and portfolio as I work through the comprehensive **[The Complete JavaScript Course 2024: From Zero to Expert!](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-javascript-course/)** by Jonas Schmedtmann.

My goal is to master modern JavaScript, from fundamentals to advanced concepts, and document my progress daily. This project is a core part of my preparation for an SDE role.

## 📂 How This Repository is Organized

This repo is organized into folders, each corresponding to a major section of the course. Inside each folder, you will find:

* **`.js` / `.html` / `.css` files:** The raw code, exercises, and challenges for that topic.
* **`README.md`:** (Inside each sub-folder) My personal notes, key takeaways, code snippets, and reflections on what I learned.
